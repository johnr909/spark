This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL. You can use this theme as base for your next WordPress theme project and you are allowed to remove the link at the footer or do whatever you want.

This theme uses Composer to load required PHP files. It also and employs namespaces to keep PHP function names simple. Simply switch the namespace from 'sparkt' to something appropriate for your project. From the theme's top-lvel directory, run the following command in a terminal to generate the necessary autoload files:
$ composer dump-autoload 
 
Gulp is used to concatenate and minify the theme's CSS files. There is no CSS-preprocessing. To set the Gulp watcher to minify and concatenate the theme's CSS files, terminal into the theme's '<theme name>/inc/assets' directory and run: 
$ gulp watchFiles

Take a look at 'gulpfile.js' in the theme's '<theme name>/inc/assets' directory for more details on the available build scripts.
