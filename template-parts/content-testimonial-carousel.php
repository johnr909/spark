						Only shop I go to. The people in there are super cool 
						and know what they are talking about. The prices are UNBEATABLE. You cannot show me 
						better pricing in Denver or in Colorado for that matter. Top quality all around, 
						come here you won't regret it.</p>

					<p class="testimonial-text"><i class="fa fa-seedling"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The absolute best dispensary in Denver hands down. I live 40 minutes away from this location and it is still the only dispensary I will go to. Every member of the staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and are always willing to help their customers. Other dispensaries in Denver could learn some things from how well this place is ran.

					<p class="testimonial-text"><i class="fa fa-cannabis"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;This dispensary is by far the best I've found since 
						living in Denver. Vanilla kush is always a great pick for an indica. All the budtenders that I've shopped with have been very knowledgeable and patient.
Oh, and if you have a med card spark has the absolute best sign over deals this side of the moon. Besides what the picture lists, you also get a $10 ounce upon sign over. 
Thank you spark dispensary</p>

					<p class="testimonial-text"><i class="fa fa-seedling"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Great dispensary. I went in for medical, and the whole experience was better than most places. It has the usual checks and security, but without it being quite so in your face. Once you get inside, it is a very nice, clean and professional looking setup. The people I met there are very friendly and helpful. The prices are very good, and should be even better on deal days. The selection is better for medical than most places I have been too. They have a good range of edibles, and some of the best quality and potency in their flower too. <!-- The only issue I had was parking. There are spots to park on the street, but not many you can park in legally. There are lots nearby, but some are posted. Definitely not the best parking situation I have seen at dispensaries, but the rest of the experience was great. For medical patients, this is the best I have been too. The only issue I had, which is very minor, is that you are supposed to get a free T-shirt with a $100 purchase. I did not realize that when I went in, so did not ask about it, but I was also not told about it at the time too. Very minor thing, but if you want a free shirt, be sure to ask for it. -->

					<p class="testimonial-text"><i class="fa fa-cannabis"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a great experience there and they have a product called Ripple that is $5 cheaper than I can find anywhere else. Friendly staff as well. I actually go out of my way to go there when I am in town. I think they do a fine job. Thanks!
